Design and built a car that is capable of autonomous navigation, picking and storing certain yellow objects and unloading them in the designated area. Target recognition was accomplished by a monocular camera and image algorithms. Picking and unloading were accomplished with 3 parallel elastic ropes and a steering engine. Velocities were adjusted using PID control. Mechanical parts were designed using Solidworks, and manufactured by 3D-printing/laser cutting.

I wrote a paper describing the details of a family of RGBD cameras, ASICs and algorithms produced by Intel. It was submitted and accepted to CCD 2017, a CVPR 2017 Workshop. My coauthors were all senior management at Intel and the paper was written to inform the academic community of issues, challenges and priorities in building stereoscopic depth cameras for production use. We highlight state-of-the-art performance on modern datasets, on certain metrics, along with establishing baselines for new datasets and evaluation metrics for depth cameras in general.
