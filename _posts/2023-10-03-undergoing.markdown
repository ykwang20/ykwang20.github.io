We aim to use the minimum DoFs to keep the robot standing and utilize the remaining DoFs to accomplish the manipulation tasks. Our current approach involves utilizing RL to generate offset outputs and employing QP for precise low-level control. Consequently, the robot can maintain balance using solely the 6 DoFs of its hind legs.

I wrote a paper describing the details of a family of RGBD cameras, ASICs and algorithms produced by Intel. It was submitted and accepted to CCD 2017, a CVPR 2017 Workshop. My coauthors were all senior management at Intel and the paper was written to inform the academic community of issues, challenges and priorities in building stereoscopic depth cameras for production use. We highlight state-of-the-art performance on modern datasets, on certain metrics, along with establishing baselines for new datasets and evaluation metrics for depth cameras in general.
