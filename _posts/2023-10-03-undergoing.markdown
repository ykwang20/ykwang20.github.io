We aim to use the minimum DoFs to keep the robot standing and utilize the remaining DoFs to accomplish the manipulation tasks. Our current approach involves utilizing RL to generate offset outputs and employing QP for precise low-level control. Consequently, the robot can maintain balance using solely the 6 DoFs of its hind legs.
